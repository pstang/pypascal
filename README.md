PyPascal - A collection of python tools
=======================================

This is a small repository of purportedly useful python modules.
I wrote each of these mostly out of necessity for some application I was working on.
The quality of the work in each one may vary, reasonable attempts were made to have each module understandable, reusable, and robust.

The modules grouped here are not necessarily related.

The modules are potentially python packageable, but most are not yet set up that way.  This is a todo.

All modules target Python3.x (although many started their lives as Python2.x modules or matlab code).
